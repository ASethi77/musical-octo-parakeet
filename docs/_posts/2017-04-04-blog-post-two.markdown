Here's some progress we've made over the last couple days...

Since we are team ????????, we don't really know what we're doing. We've spent the last few days getting more up to speed on classical NLP strategies, while also taking some time to learn a little about a neat tensorflow wrapper called Keras (https://github.com/MachinesWhoLearn/lectures/blob/master/2016-2017.Meetings/spring/01.keras_tutorial_duplicate_questions/03.train_model.ipynb). Our friend Pooja has been really great in helping us go through previous NLP class slides, and we've been doing a lot of other independent work to get up to speed like going to the NLP PMP course, watching Standford lectures, etc.
